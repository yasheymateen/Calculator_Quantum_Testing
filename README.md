# Calculator_Quantum_Testing
* Showcasing an advanced futuristic technology based on quantum calculations, which tends to skew the result due to small quantum error.

## Objective:
* A testing project to test which one of two crystals has a higher accuracy rate.
* Accuracy rate is derived from the calculations from the type of crystal used to store the Qbits. 

## Implementation
* Java
* Maven
* Eclipse IDE
